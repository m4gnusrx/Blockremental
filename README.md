# Story
Blockremental is a game where you are a little block guy who has to create Blocks (count denoted by ◻) to make your Block world bigger. These are used to power up Generators (generator power denoted by ◼<sup>tier</sup>, which produce those blocks.)

# Generators
These consist of a count and a multiplier meaning these produce the resource these are producing at the rate of (count × mult)/s also known as the power.The exponent of the black square indicates its tier which determines the resource it's producing. Primary (Tier 1)
Generators produce Blocks, Secondary (Tier 2) Generators produce Primary Generators, and so on up to the Denary (Tier 10) Generators producing Nonary (Tier 9) Generators. These work similar to the dimensions in Antimatter Dimensions by Hevipelle, except for the fact
that the prices of these generators increase per purchase instead of every 10, and the fact I can count to nine, and even ten. Every time you power up a generator...

Its count is increased by 1 <br>
Its multiplier is doubled <br>
Its cost is multiplied by 10<sup>2<sup>(tier - 1)</sup><sup>

# Upgrades
These upgrades boost the game's progression. Simple as that.

### 1. Generator Reboot
This upgrade resets your generators and blocks, but it increases the multiplier base. Multiplier Base starts at 2.00× and increases by 0.50× per Generator Reboot.
